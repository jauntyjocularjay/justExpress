Packet Layers include:

Physical    - cables
Link        - Wifi, ethernet protocol
Network     - IP
Transport   - UDP/TCP
Application - HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMIP

Network + Transport Layer = TCP/IP

Localhost ports are one of 2^16 ports opened by Node

Data added to ->
Transport segment, added to -> Network Segment
Network Segment includes
Source port address, end point address

UDP
for Real Time data transfer
sends data regardless, only sends once

TCP
Connection base, verifies connection, awaits response, sends data
Delivery acknowledgement
Retransmission: if data is lost, sends data to complete
Transmits packets in order
throttles latency for more efficient transfer

TCP for reliability - HTTP relies on TCP
UDP for Fast, but can be somewhat unreliable

TCP/IP is the transport layer (instead of UDP) that connects and sustains connection between two computers
